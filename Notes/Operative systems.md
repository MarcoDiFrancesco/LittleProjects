# Operative systems

## What is an OS

An operative system is a bundle of software that is used between hardware and man. The OS offers an environment to control and coordinate the usage of the HW from application programs (programmi applicativi). To make it efficient, the OS manages the conflicts (e.g. 2 uses access the same resource). The OS make abstraction of the written code, allowinf an easier usage of the machine. The OS manages the HW resources like disks, memory and SW like programs. The operative system is always on (or at least a part of the kernel), because it needs to have the control over the machine. The SO checks the efficiency and abstraction. If a program does not have good performance, it does not make sense to use an OS.

OS example:

## Generations

**Polling** is used to interact between CPU and I/O using blocking instructions. To override CPU and I/O is necessary to have an asynchronous mechanism. So the CPU stop when I/O finishes the operation, so I/O sends signal to the CPU and CPU stops what it is doing saving the state, makes the operation and start again with what it was doing.

**Direct memory access** uses the principle of polling but sends interrupt signal with a block of information.

**Buffering** when CPU and I/O are making the same job.  
**Spooling** when CPU and I/O are making different jobs.

The problem with spooling is that the disks are sequential, so random access disks are introduced.

## Kernel

The kernel can be executed in 3 different ways:

- kernel executed separately
- kernel executed on a user process
- kernel executed as a process

The kernel executed in a **separately environment** uses a part of the memory that is not used by any other process, it is more privileged than other processes. This was used in momolitic kernel once upon a time.

The kernel executed in **user processes** so each process has the structures to call all functionalities of the kernel (a reference to them). The kernel functionalities are not replicated in each process, they are poining to a process contining all of the functionalities.
This type of kernel is more performant, because when there is a system call, the switch between user mode and kernel mode is faster than making a mod switch because we are in the same process, if we would be in two different processes, we would require to make the context switch.

The kernel stack contains all the processes that are running.  
The shared address space is shared across all processes.

Kernel as user process:

![Shared kernel model](https://i.imgur.com/AQ1If7H.png)

## Processes

Program is a **static** instance.  
Process is a **dynamic** instance.

The image of the memory contains:

- instructions (code)
- variables
- stack call and local variables
- dyncamic memory
- attributes (id, state, control)

![Image memory](https://i.imgur.com/lEF9Kh0.png)

Process states:

![Process states](https://i.imgur.com/rJxqp6k.png)

## Dispathcher

Dispatcher is used by CPU to manage processes:

- Context switch: operation where the state is saved/restored in the process control block
- Kernel mode to user mode
- Loading into the program counter of the next process

Process flow:

![https://i.imgur.com/wD59Jtx.png](https://i.imgur.com/wD59Jtx.png)

When a process is created it is attached to the father process.  
When a fork is made to create a clild process.
The father process can wait for the child process to finish or can run in asyncronous mode (concurrent).

### Thread

In a process there are multiple threads. A thread is the minimum usage of the CPU and the process is the minimum usage of resources.

A thread is always attached to a process.

The thread has:

- execution state (stopped, running, ...)
- program counter (the following process that needs to be executed)
- registers (of the CPU)
- stack

![Thread](https://i.imgur.com/in1TxZu.png)

The threads have been created because if a process has a thread blocked, can still run in other threads.  
The thread have also the memory shared, so the access in memory is faster.
The context switch is way faster in threads, compared to processes.
For example in Solaris the creation of a process is 30 time slower than the creation of a thread. And the context switch is 5 time slower.
Another vantage is scalabity, a process is not possible to be scaled and with a thread it is.

Threads status can be:

- ready
- in execution
- waiting

When a process waits it can block the other threads in the process or can make them running, depending on the implementation.

![Kernel](https://i.imgur.com/Z3LFyUE.png)

### Mapping threads user space to kernel space

Threads can be implemented on kernel level or user level.
All OSs(Linux, Unix, Windows) make a combination of the 2, so some threads are mapped one to one from kernel space to user space, some are mapped such as some threads in user space (for example 3) are mapped to some in kernel space (for example 2). This happens because at kernel space the threads are a fixed number, in user space can possibly be infinite.

Advantages of user-level kernel: faster and no context-switch needed, programmers can work with threads.  
A disadvantage is that once a kernel in user mode is locked, the process locks (can be solved by programmers), another one is that it's not possible to use parallelism.  
Advantages kernel-level thread: if a process blocks it can continue, parallelism is possible.  
Disadvantage kernel-level thread: low efficiency.

## Inter Process Communication

Inter process communication (communication between processes) is the technique to make 2 processes communicate. This needs to be fast and secure, the information inside a process needs to be protected.  
This can be done in a shared space or can be done by the kernel.  
Memory can be shared between one or more processes.
General purpouse OSs implements both.

![Inter process communication](https://i.imgur.com/6WXAmyZ.png)

Advantages of kernel mediation are: more secure because kernel checks everything and in the shared space the processes need to remember that they are working with information that is shared.

Advantages of shared memory: faster because context switch is easier.

### IPC (Inter Process Communication) message passing

Inter Process Communication message passing make the communication between the processes.  
**Symmetric** IPC are done through `send(Process1, message)` and `receive(Process2, message)`.  
**Asymmetric** IPC are done through `send(Process1, message)` and `receive(id, message)`, it's used id because it can receive from more than 2 processes.  
If you want to send to more than one processes a message, it's convenient to use **mailboxes**. So can be used `send(MailboxA, message)` and `receive(MailboxA, message)`.

Send and receiveive can be **blocking**. If a send is blocking the receiver blocks until the message is received. If a receive is blocking the receiver blocks until the message is available.

## Scheduler

The scheduler assigns the processes to the CPU.  
The processes, when they are ready, they go into the queue.  
A process can be waiting for somthing, like waiting for an input or waiting for a device to be plugged in.  
There are multiple queues of processes, for example for each I/O device there is a different queue. The processes in the queue are attached in head each other.

![Processes queue](https://i.imgur.com/njJCIuU.png)

The scheduler manages these processes.

### Short and long therm schedulers

The long therm scheduler select the processes to be put in the queue.  
The short therm scheduler select the processes to be put in the CPU.  
The short therm scheduler needs to be really fast. Short therm scheduler can be slower.  
A long therm scheduler needs to mix the I/O bound (short CPU bust) and CPU bound (long CPU bust).  
The mid term scheduler uses virtual memory, that moves the processes from the RAM in the ready queue to the memory in order to execute other (more important) processes.

![Mid therm scheduler](https://i.imgur.com/TQ6qhLm.png)

### CPU scheduler (short therm scheduler)

This is how CPU distributes the load:

![CPU scheduler](https://i.imgur.com/z5wJerR.png)

## Preemption

**Preemptive shedulers** can force the CPU to leave the process and put it back to queue.  
**Non-preemptive schedulers** need to wait for the process.

![Preemptive scheduler](https://i.imgur.com/U4G0Lhd.png)

Processes view with swapped processes.

![Processes frow](https://i.imgur.com/d0DhyEi.png)

The schedulers metrics are:

- **use of CPU**, most use of the CPU
- **throughput**: number of processes for time unit
- **waiting time**: time spent in queue for a process
- **turnaround time**: time to execute a process from the moment of submission to the moment of completion
- **response time**: time from the moment a request is submitted to the moment a reponse is received

Maximize:

- use of CPU
- throughput

Minimize:

- waiting time
- turnaround time
- response time

## Scheduling algorithms

### First-Come First-Served algorithm

This is a FIFO algorithm. Itâ€™s really easy to implement.

This is an algorithm without [preemption](#preemption), this mean waiting-time(Tw) and response-time (Tr) are always 0.

The problem with this algorithm is that if a process with a large burst is exectured, the writing-time (when all the process started, but still are not done) will be long.

FCFS algorithm example:

![https://i.imgur.com/kYWkGj7.png](https://i.imgur.com/kYWkGj7.png)

### Shortest-Job-First

The SJF gives priority to the processes with shortest burst. Of this schema there are two versions: preemptive and not preemtive. The non-preemptive version makes no more than what described above. The preemptive version interrupt the running process if a process with a shorter burst comes, so if a process with remaning burst=8 and a process comes to the queue with a burst=6 the switch is made.

The preemptive version has the **best waiting-time**.

Non-preemptive example:

![https://i.imgur.com/vkBv98E.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkBv98E.png)

Preemptive example, aka **Shortest Remaining Time First** (in this example the switch time is not counted):

![https://i.imgur.com/MlL0Cao.png](https://i.imgur.com/MlL0Cao.png)

### Time approximation

The problem with the algorithms above is that the CPU burst time is not known, to solve this, an estimation needs to be made with the time burst of the past.

Time estimation:

![https://i.imgur.com/w33odLr.png](https://i.imgur.com/w33odLr.png)

### Priority of processes

![https://i.imgur.com/VPGxDcQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/VPGxDcQ.png)

Priority

Priority example:

![https://i.imgur.com/o4RXGV1.png](https://i.imgur.com/o4RXGV1.png)

### Starvation

With the priority comes the problem of **starvation**. This means that if a process has a low priority, the process could never be executed if there is always a process with a higher priority.

A solution to this could be **aging**, this means if Iâ€™ve been waiting for too long I get a higher priority.

### Higher Response Ratio Next

The HRRN is **non-preemptive algorithm** and it uses the aging method.

Is calculated as: `(t_waiting + t_burst)/t_burst` = `1 + (t_waiting/t_burst)`.

The priority could be calculated:

- each time a process finishes (more expensive)
- each time a process finishes but only if a new process is added (cheaper)

HRRN example calculating each time the priority:

![https://i.imgur.com/vnkQwMt.png](https://i.imgur.com/vnkQwMt.png)

HRRN example

### Round robin

The processes are divided by quants, then the round robin algorithm takes one process and execute it for a quant of time, then [preempted](#preemption). The queue is **circular**. The quant varies **from 10 to 100 millisenconds**. If I finish my job (or wait for another process) before the quant finieshes, I leave the CPU before my assigned time terminates. But the next process will have only the usual assigned time, e.g.Â it takes for me 50ms of burst over 100ms of quant, then the next process wonâ€™t have 150ms, but just 100. This is a good algorithm for time sharing, so for a machine with **shared user** usage because users. This algorithm is a FCFS. The quant canâ€™t be chosen bigger than the burst of all services, because then it would be a FCFS. If itâ€™s too small then there will be too many context switches. The quant usually is chosen so 80% of the processes execute before the quant expire. The quant is **chosen dinamically**, so the OS change it on the fly.

Round robin example with quant = 2:

![https://i.imgur.com/OcXzpXz.png](https://i.imgur.com/OcXzpXz.png)

Round robin

Example exercises:

![https://i.imgur.com/HcMFkku.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HcMFkku.jpg)

![https://i.imgur.com/zomBU78.png](https://i.imgur.com/zomBU78.png)

## Multilevel queue without feedback

The algorithm seen before are different from whatâ€™s used in real life. In real life, different queues are used for diffrent types of processes. For example an algotitm for foreground processes could be round robin and one for background processes could be FCFS.

To manage the various queue there is the sheduling based on time slice. This means for example:

- 80% of time for foreground with RR
- 20% of time for background with FCFS

and when the CPU finishes the 20% of time (for example 100ms) then itâ€™s forced to switch to background processes.

Example priority of queue:

![https://i.imgur.com/lNLmeRn.png](https://i.imgur.com/lNLmeRn.png)

In the static queues the processes are evaluated only the first time I see that process, there it remains until it ends. Here there is the problem that the processes are not evaluated watching the code, if I miss the category, I could have a less performant execution.

## Multilevel queue with feedback

In real systems there are the **multilevel queue with feedback**, so the process can move between queues depending on characteristics. A multilevel queue with feedback example:

![https://i.imgur.com/VruCjGg.png](https://i.imgur.com/VruCjGg.png)

## Fair share

Fair share divides the CPU in more slices and here the processes are ran by app. So if an app have 2 processes and an app have 10, this avoids that the process with the most processes to have priority. Fair share example:

![https://i.imgur.com/VP81fwI.png](https://i.imgur.com/VP81fwI.png)

## Models to evalutate an algorithm

**Deterministic algorithm** is the model we made in the previous exercises. So if we know the processes that go into it, we can predict the output. The problem is that if we change processes the output changes.

**Model with network of queues** we can make predictions with distribution of CPU burst and IO burst with the likelyhood that they happen, and we can show in a graph for example the distribution of the processes.

**Model with simulation** uses real patterns (historic data) or the statistic data used before.

**Implementation** tries in real life.

## Sync between processes

Because there are shared resources an algorithm that manages the order of the execution of the processes needs to think also to syncronization of the processes.

Problem of producer and consumer:

- procucer: make the message
- consumer: uses the message

The execution of these read and write needs to be synced and the buffer used is limited in size.

Buffer used by the processes **is circular**:

- **in** has the first free position
- **out** has the first busy position

![https://i.imgur.com/bbcguZZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bbcguZZ.png)

Buffer code:

![https://i.imgur.com/25tnV1a.png](https://i.imgur.com/25tnV1a.png)

The problem with this script is that the CPU can stop the process in any time, so for example in the consumer script it could stop the execution before the line `counter++` and this would mean not updating the counter. And this is an example that could happen (counter is shared between processes):

![https://i.imgur.com/Wgepsvb.png](https://i.imgur.com/Wgepsvb.png)

Buffer code

And this would resolve in inconsistency.

The soulution to this is **critical section**.

## Critical section

Critical section is a piece of code in which we acess a shared resource.

The criteria that critical section needs to respect are:

- **mutex** (mutua esclusione): one process at a time can access resources
- **progress**: only processes that are entring can decide how enters
- **bounded waiting**: there must be a max number of times on which the process will wait, so the wait is not infinite

These 3 criateria can be associates with the bathroom:

- only one person can enter
- only people that are outside the bathroom decide who enters (the person that was inside the bathroom doesnâ€™t decide)
- the people that wait outside have a limited time to wait

Critical section of a program is written by the programmer, the programmer must write only itâ€™s critical section, not the one of other programs.

Algorithm 1, **wrong** algorithm:

![https://i.imgur.com/CuC4C8N.png](https://i.imgur.com/CuC4C8N.png)

The problem with this algorithm is that if a process exits, then the other one wait for him and never enters. For example j terminate, then i wait for ever there. So **progress** is not respected.

Algorithm 2, **wrong** algorithm:

![https://i.imgur.com/atbpwPr.png](https://i.imgur.com/atbpwPr.png)

The problem of the process waiting forever is solved, because in case one goes away it will have the flag set to false. So process is now respected. The problem is that the flag could be set to true before the while is entered (critical section) so there will be a deadlock situation:

![https://i.imgur.com/z27D6m4.png](https://i.imgur.com/z27D6m4.png)

Algorithm 3:

![https://i.imgur.com/EICjmVo.png](https://i.imgur.com/EICjmVo.png)

This algorithm checks both if itâ€™s the correct turn and if the process has the key. Now we need to solve the problem for more than one processes.

## Lamportâ€™s bakery algorithm

Here we solve the problem of having more than 2 processes.

Algorithm 1, **wrong**, the problem with this solution is that the `max(number[0], ... , number[N-1])` is atomic, so it could be calculated and the the context switch made without the `number[i]`:

![https://i.imgur.com/TglFJ93.png](https://i.imgur.com/TglFJ93.png)

Algorithm 2, **wrong** what is changing here is that if a process did not finish to choose the number in which it will enter the queue, the processes will not be executed because they wait for everyone to choose itâ€™s number:

![https://i.imgur.com/4HqbWCw.png](https://i.imgur.com/4HqbWCw.png)

Algorithm 3, **right** there were the software solution, the problem is that itâ€™s really a complex solution and there is a lot of time wasting checking in the while:

![https://i.imgur.com/jzpQAhK.png](https://i.imgur.com/jzpQAhK.png)

## Hardware solutions

A solution is to diable interupt while a shared variable is being accessed, the problem is that then a process can take how much time it wants and possibly blocking the access to other processes.

One solution is **test and set**:

![https://i.imgur.com/hAAv0u1.png](https://i.imgur.com/hAAv0u1.png)

![https://i.imgur.com/FueM0xu.png](https://i.imgur.com/FueM0xu.png)

This test is always atomic. This function allows to set the lock to the processes that are called are return the previous state of them, if it was set to FALSE, so the lock was open then it would enter the critical section.

Onther solution is **swap**:

![https://i.imgur.com/EHKHvYg.png](https://i.imgur.com/EHKHvYg.png)

![https://i.imgur.com/lNDZ8Lx.png](https://i.imgur.com/lNDZ8Lx.png)

The problem with swap and test and set is that a process could always be executed, terminate and come back in the critical section continuously, never leaving time for the other processes to enter.

Here is the solution to this problem:

![https://i.imgur.com/6tu26mY.png](https://i.imgur.com/6tu26mY.png)

This solution allows to set FALSE to the lock only in the case there are no other processes that are waiting to go in the critic section.

This solution is not making less complex the system so between hardware and sofware doesnâ€™t really metter. The solution to this is using semaphores.

### Semaphores

Semaphores are way reasier than the algorithms seen before. The semaphores are implemented in newer opeative systems. Semaphores reduces complexity, and the busy waiting situation.

Semaphores actions are:

- V that increments S of 1
- P waits
  - if S > 0, decrement S of 1
  - else, needs to wait

Semaphores can be either binary (0 or 1, sometimes True and False) or generic (value int > 0).

Conceptual execution of **binary** semaphores:

![https://i.imgur.com/dcssv4G.png](https://i.imgur.com/dcssv4G.png)

Conceptual execution of **generic** semaphores:

![https://i.imgur.com/gEuzSsU.png](https://i.imgur.com/gEuzSsU.png)

These 2 piece of code are evaluated in one time, so in a atomic trasnsaction.

There are two implementation:

- **with busy waiting**: the process wastes memrory waiting for itself to end
- **without busy waiting**: the process ends immedialy and switches to the next process immedialy

Busy waiting is also called **spin lock**, spin because of the while (watch next pic), lock because it locks the process.

Semaphore implemenation with busy waiting. In this implementation the Swap is a atomic transaction, so it is ensured by the hardware that this transaction cannot be stopped in the middle:

![https://i.imgur.com/syuoNlm.png](https://i.imgur.com/syuoNlm.png)

For the implementation with non binary semaphores **with busy waiting**:

![https://i.imgur.com/XWokXUH.png](https://i.imgur.com/XWokXUH.png)

Implementation on V **without busy waiting**, in this implementation there is a list of all the processes (PCB or process control block). In this case the process is appended to the list and itâ€™s put into sleep, so it leaves the CPU making other process run. So P(delay) is not run, saving computing time:

![https://i.imgur.com/C8zXRJm.png](https://i.imgur.com/C8zXRJm.png)

Implementation on P **without busy waiting**. This wakes up the processes in case there are processes that are waiting. The problem with this implemenation is the starvation that could occure if we have a list with priorities, if we have FCFS this doesnâ€™t happen:

![https://i.imgur.com/DqBQM8K.png](https://i.imgur.com/DqBQM8K.png)

Usually in the OS the **busy waiting is accepted** and implemented instead of the list of processes.

The execution is normally:

![https://i.imgur.com/xwHdt26.png](https://i.imgur.com/xwHdt26.png)

Here s could be called in other ways, the important thing is that P and V are called with their names.

## Semaphores exercises

I want to execute before A, then B:

![https://i.imgur.com/ACBNqtS.png](https://i.imgur.com/ACBNqtS.png)

Processes that wait each other:

![https://i.imgur.com/OwS7Wmi.png](https://i.imgur.com/OwS7Wmi.png)

A limitation of the semaphores is the **deadlock**. Deadlock example:

![https://i.imgur.com/ztiS9RS.png](https://i.imgur.com/ztiS9RS.png)

Another problem is **starvation**, for example if I forget a V, then a process is never run.

## Producer and consumer problem

The **problem of the producer and consumer** has the buffer of N elements that need to be checked (if there is space to produce or consume) before entering the produce or consume section. We need to introduce **full** and **empty** semaphores. Producer and consumer problem:

![https://i.imgur.com/7eCx9yV.png](https://i.imgur.com/7eCx9yV.png)

## Dinning philosophers problem

![https://i.imgur.com/ZpoKAJv.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZpoKAJv.png)

We can solve this problem trying to take the right and left sticks, then eating.

![https://i.imgur.com/rtNDJw1.png](https://i.imgur.com/rtNDJw1.png)

Here we have the deadlock situation, because if everyone takes the right strick, then no one eats.

Wrong solutions:

![https://i.imgur.com/VqUaicU.png](https://i.imgur.com/VqUaicU.png)

All of these change what the problem asked, so they are wrong. For example the first one remove one filosopher, but the problem asked for all of them at the same time. Or the third one adds a token, not allowed.

Soultion:

![https://i.imgur.com/IJer85Y.png](https://i.imgur.com/IJer85Y.png)

Is this solution is really important to avoid describing the Think() and Eat() because these two do not have problems of concurrecy.

The solution is in testing if the two pilosophers close to me are hungry on not. If they are, I donâ€™t take sticks.

![https://i.imgur.com/ZTwQPQT.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZTwQPQT.png)

![https://i.imgur.com/eOSecjT.png](https://i.imgur.com/eOSecjT.png)

In this part I donâ€™t only putj the fork back to available, I also put the philosophers close to me in eating state, in the case they were hungry. This last step **avoid deadlock** but **not starvation** (only in the case of spare number of philosophers). The starvation problem is solved by adding some sort of priority to the solution.

## Sleepy barber problem

Problem:

![https://i.imgur.com/qWaKOiY.png](https://i.imgur.com/qWaKOiY.png)

Solution:

![https://i.imgur.com/XTFQnlk.png](https://i.imgur.com/XTFQnlk.png)

## Limitation of the semaphores

The main problem with semaphores is the raising complexity going up with the complexity of the problem.

There are alternatives to this that are: monitor and java syncronized casses in Java.

## Monitor

The monitor is used as a subsititute to the semaphores. The main difference is that the semaphores are implemented directly by the programmer, and the monitors are implemented through high level programming languages like Java.

The monitors garants mutex, so **only one** shared variable at a time will be accessed, so mutex are not needed.

In monitors there are condition variables, these are used to sync monitors. These conditions can receive `wait()` and `signal()`, that are not the same as P and V of the semaphores. Example: `x.wait()`.

The `wait()` stops the process anyway, in the semaphores the P checks if value is 1 or 0 to stop or not. The `signal()` wakes up a process, also this is different from V because in the semaphores if 2 V consecutive are called, then 2 processes are called, with signal only the first one is, so the second one does not do anything.

Monitor producer and consumer:

## Writes and readers problem

Rules:

- readers can only read
- writers can only write
- more than one readers can read the same file
- only one writer can write in a file
- if a writer is writing, a reader canâ€™t read it

Writers solution:

![https://i.imgur.com/FLERJ9u.png](https://i.imgur.com/FLERJ9u.png)

Readers solution:

![https://i.imgur.com/pqiCrsq.png](https://i.imgur.com/pqiCrsq.png)

The problem with this solution is **starvation**.

## Deadlock

The deadlock happens when processes are waiting for resources to be freed, and these resources are occupied by resources that are waiting for other locked resources. Deadlock example:

![https://i.imgur.com/V1S7GjY.png](https://i.imgur.com/V1S7GjY.png)

The problem above can be solved with preemption of rollback. With preemption we donâ€™t allow more than one car at a time in the bridge, with rollback, we make a car go back to itâ€™s track, the problem with this is that if there are more than one car to rollback, then there rollback is not light in performances.

Execution of 2 processes:

![https://i.imgur.com/2PqjCEF.png](https://i.imgur.com/2PqjCEF.png)

Deadlock possibilities:

![https://i.imgur.com/8PXEu3g.png](https://i.imgur.com/8PXEu3g.png)

In the execution above, in the 6 possibilities, 2 of them go into a deadlock situation.

The conditions to have a deadlock are:

![https://i.imgur.com/UXhzZYi.png](https://i.imgur.com/UXhzZYi.png)

A model to understand if there are deadlock is RAG.

### RAG - Resouce Allocation Graph

The RAG is:

![https://i.imgur.com/ABF8wFh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ABF8wFh.png)

Rag example:

![https://i.imgur.com/IibLWFY.png](https://i.imgur.com/IibLWFY.png)

Here we need to check if we have cycles inside:

![https://i.imgur.com/wF5BnVx.png](https://i.imgur.com/wF5BnVx.png)

In this example we have a cycle between P1 and P3. We also have a cycle inside the second exaple, but in the case R1 is locked by P2, when P2 frees up, then P3 is able to run, the same thing with P4. In the first case it isnâ€™t the same thing, because both R1 and R2 are waiting for P2, in the case it is blocked, then R2 and R3 are blocked, whitch create a deadlock.

What to do when something like this happens? Static prevention; dynamic prevention; detenction and recovery; not doing anything.

## Static prevention

With hold and wait the process allocate all the resources that it needs to use, then if a context switch comes and another process is waiting for that resource, it wonâ€™t be able to do anything, so there is a waste of memory. Hold and wait can also cause starvation.

Another possibility to solve the deadlock problem is forcing a process to release all itâ€™s resources before locking others. The problem with this solution is that not all the processes can do thing, take for instance a printer, it canâ€™t be stopped after printing 3 pages, do something else and then come back doing what it was doing in the other process.

Static prevention in not used in real world applications because of its cost.

## Dynamic prevention

The dynamic prevention requires to know the used resources by the processes. If it doesnâ€™t have this information, it will use the maximum possible resources used, and this could lead into resources waste.

This prevention checks if the system is in a safe state, this means no deadlock. The system is in a safe state if using the resources itâ€™s possible to allocate in some order the processes available. If there isnâ€™t a safe state, then itâ€™s unsafe, so a deadlock could occure.

In this example the state is safe in the orfer P1 P0 P2.

The dynamic prevention requires every process that is accessed to be in a safe state.

There are 2 Dynamic prevention algorithms:

- RAG slightly modified
- Banker's algorithm

RAG example:

## Bankerâ€™s algorithm

The idea behind this algorighm a bank that have 1000 bank accounts with in total 1.000.000 euros, the money that it needs to have available to give back to the users is way lower than the amount of money that the user really have, because cases like all the users come in the same day and closes all the accounts is almost impossible. If a user ask for a small amount of money, the bank gives it immedialy, if requires a big amount, the bank ask him to come back in some days.

The algorithm requires that the processes to know the used resources. If a process ask resources, if the state is still in a safe state without that resources, then the resources are allocated, if not the resources are not allocated.

The banker algorithm is divided in 2 algorithms:

Allocation algorithm:

### Deadlock & restore

This solution is taken if a process goes in deadlock, and we need to restore from it.

The main **advantage** of this tecnique is that itâ€™s not necessary to know before the amount of resources required.

The main **disadvantage** is that there is an high cost to recover.

There are 2 solutions to this:

- Using RAG (sesource allocation graph)
- Rilevamento using kind of bankerâ€™s algorithm

Restoring **using RAG**:

![https://i.imgur.com/h8paGix.png](https://i.imgur.com/h8paGix.png)

The RAG is used removing the resources, and watching the processes. In this case there is a dealock situation because there is a cycle in P2, P3, P4, P1.

Rilevamento **using kind of bankerâ€™s agorithm**:

It checks only for the safe state, not a possible allocation (like in the bankerâ€™s algorithm), it is also not called every time a new process is added, it will be called every n processes executed.

The main difference with the bankerâ€™s algorithm is that there is no computation of the order that the processes need to be executed not to have deadlock, we just know that there is one that works.

### Restore

To restore from a deadlock the possibilities are 2:

- kill the processes in deadlock
- preemption of the resources of the locked processes

The soution with **killing the processes** are 2:

- killing all in one
- killing one by one, the problem that comes is, in what order we do it?

A solution to this can be [aging](#Starvation).

## Conclusion

A good solution for deadlock is a combination of the soulutions OR using the **ostrich** (struzzo) solution, so donâ€™t handle the deadlocks.

## Memory

Something is a process only if some **central memory is assigned to it**. The program to be executed must be in the central memory. For example a process loaded in memory writes some variables in the memory, then when context switch happens, the results are written in memory. Then when a process terminates, the memory need to be released.

The transformation between program memory written in the disk, to memory allocation that is located in the main memory. This takes place through:

- Compiler
- Linker
- Loader

Translation process:

![https://i.imgur.com/5yvFtzV.png](https://i.imgur.com/5yvFtzV.png)

The binding process can be at:

- Compile time
- Load time
- Run time

Binding process description:

![https://i.imgur.com/VdszfNa.png](https://i.imgur.com/VdszfNa.png)

Binding process example:

![https://i.imgur.com/MYAy5Kg.png](https://i.imgur.com/MYAy5Kg.png)

At runtime the address (1000) is loaded from the hardware, this could change with a context switch, for example 1000 becomes 2000, then all the adresses need to be calculated again.

## Linking

Linking can be static or dynamic:

- Static means the libraries are copied into the executable.
- Dynamic means the libraries are taken at runtime (lighter executable) (for example DDL libraries)

Loading can be static or dyncamic:

- Static: all code is loaded in memory
- Dynamic: code is splited and if there are piece of code not needed, they are not loaded

## Spazi di indirizzamento

The **address space** can be logical or physical. The difference is that at compile or load time, the logical and physical adresses coincide, at run time, itâ€™s likely that they are different:

![https://i.imgur.com/fStzLp9.png](https://i.imgur.com/fStzLp9.png)

The **Memory Management Unit** (MMU) is the thing that at run time gives the assign the addresses. For example a logical process says it has the memory between 0 and 20K, and the MMU assign the physical address between 50K and 70K (at run time).

The binding in new computer is always dynamic, because it canâ€™t be possible to predict which part of the memory is going to be used by a program. This is possible to make it only in embedded system, because itâ€™s possible to predict all the memory that will be allocated.

## Memory management

Here we see how the memory is assigned to a process.

## Fixed partition technique

The **fixed partition technique** works in dividing the memory in partitions. This works allocating the memory required to the partition that are available and the partition that can fit the memory required.

It can work in different ways. For example with **FCFS** (first come first served) the processes waits in queue until the memory that they need is free. The problem with this is that if there are 2 memory blocks of 16MB, then the second one needs to wait for the first one, also if there were some blocks (for example 1MB) that had the possibility to go without waiting for the 16MB block.

Another way is **First Available Fit**, that says fit the block also if itâ€™s smaller. Better than FCFS.

So the disadvantages of First Available Fit are:

- this type of segmentation needs to set a fixed value for each memory block, wasting space if itâ€™s not used, and also itâ€™s not possible to resize the blocks on the fly
- there is a lot of waste of memory, if a process is 1M and the smallest block is 4MB, then the 4MB is used with a memory waste of 3MB
- if a process is bigger than the biggest size of the biggest segment, than that process will never be executed. For example one process is 18M, and the segmentations are 16M, 8M, 4M; then there wonâ€™t be the possiblity to execute it

![https://i.imgur.com/6XlPIcX.png](https://i.imgur.com/6XlPIcX.png)

2 problems of these solutions are:

- **Internal fragmentation** when the process is smaller than the assigned memory block, so there is a waste of memory.
- **External fragmentation** when the process is too big and itâ€™s not fitting in the available memory block.

## Dynamic partition technique

This technique there is no fixed size of memory blocks, so there is only one big partition that is splitted in smaller memory blocks on the fly.

When the memory is assigned it looks like this:

![https://i.imgur.com/VcPp8Qz.png](https://i.imgur.com/VcPp8Qz.png)

Here we can decide how to allocate new incoming memory blocks: with **best fit** we can fit the incoming process in the smallest memory block that we have, where that block fits, the problem with this is that itâ€™s almost sure that the memory block remaining (if the memory block wasnâ€™t exactly the size available) no other process will fit.

Another possibility is to fit the the memory block that is the **biggest memory block** available, so we solve the previous problem. Here we have the problem that we need to scan the entire list to understand what block to chose.

Another possibility is to fit the block in the **first available memory block**, and itâ€™s proven to be the best (in real world applications) because is way faster than the other 2.

Here we solved the problem of internal fragmentation, but we still have the problem of external fragmentation. We can solve this problem making the reallocation of the memory but this reallocation is really expensive.

## Buddy system

There is also a technique called **buddy system** trying always to split in 2 the memory until we find the space in which fits. In this system we still have the problem of internal fragmentation but we have the advantage that when 2 blocks of 256KB close, they form a 512KB, that is different from the fixed size blocks. Buddy system example:

![https://i.imgur.com/XLQgfhs.png](https://i.imgur.com/XLQgfhs.png)

## Pagination

The problem we want to solve is the internal and external fragmentation. For example in the buddy system if we fragment the blocks and we have 2 different blocks that are not closed by, we won't be able to use those 2 blocks for one process. Pagination example:

![https://i.imgur.com/l3zYMrN.png](https://i.imgur.com/l3zYMrN.png)

With pagination if the dimention of a page is 1KB and the program requires 2.3KB, then 3 pages will be used. With this solution there is still a little bit of memory waste, but not a lot. How memory gets divided:

![https://i.imgur.com/qp4nJEJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/qp4nJEJ.png)

In pagination we also have a more difficult translation in addressing space MMU.

![https://i.imgur.com/KjSCb8p.png](https://i.imgur.com/KjSCb8p.png)

Translation example:

![https://i.imgur.com/YWkrUsJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/YWkrUsJ.png)

This addresses are written in the **page table** that sits in memory. We can find the page table adress in the registers of the CPU, the adress and the lenght. The problem with this solution is that the memory needs to be accessed 2 times in order to be used.

We solve this with the **translation look-aside buffer** (TLB) that is a small accociative memory that contains a small amount memory addresses. So we first check the TLB, if there is a miss, then we look in the memory (as explained above) taking more time. The TLB is useful only if there is a low miss rate.

MMU with TLB:

![https://i.imgur.com/Q7rDMBa.png](https://i.imgur.com/Q7rDMBa.png)

Because the TLB is really costy because we need to clear it each time there is a context switch, so we can't keep all the adresses in the TLB.

We also have protection inside this table:

![https://i.imgur.com/eGFH5PZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/eGFH5PZ.png)

With pagination we have a big advantage: we can use one page for more than one processes. For example we can set two processes to read one page in read-only mode, so saving space because we don't need to write 2 different pages.

The **problem with bare pagination** is that in a page you can put code (that can be read by one ore more process) and data (that is specific for a process) in the same page. This means that, that page can't be share with more than one process.

We solve this problem with **segmentation** (not the one we talked before). With this solution we separate the data in more categories: main, function, procedures, variables, stack, vectors, etc. . These segments are contained in the same memory block:

![https://i.imgur.com/KlJDZWS.png](https://i.imgur.com/KlJDZWS.png)

These segmentation is stored in a TLB using the segment-table base register STBR and segmente-table lenght register STLR. When we look at the adress we also need to check if there actually is a memory segment or not.

A problem with the segmentation is that we could have **external fragmentation**.

## Segmented pagination

In segmented pagination there is a **page table for each segment**. In phisical memory there is only the concept of frame, not the one of segments. The concept of segments it's inside each frame.

One OSs that use segmented pagination are MULTICS and ARMv7a.

Iniziamo con un esempio di quelli classici Il produttore e il consumatore

Dove il produttore produce il messaggio e lo mette in un buffer mentre il consumatore lo prende dal buffer e lo consuma
Questo problema contiene dei vincoli ovvero il buffer e limitato (non posso creare elementi all infinito senza consumarli e non posso consumarne senza averne creati)
I due processi per funzionare correttamente devono dialogare in qualche modo uno con l'altro

I parametri per controllare la correttezza di due processi che devono essere sincronizzati (cioe che per esempio devono accedere alla stessa zona di memoria) 1. Mutua esclusione
Fondamentale parametro che dice che i processi devon accedere uno alla volta alla sezione critica 2. Progresso
Solo i processi che stanno per entrare nella sezione critica decidono chi entra
E la decisione non puÃ² essere rimandata all'infinito 3. Attesa limitata
Chiamato anche bounded waiting
Deve esistere un numero di volte massimo per cui il processo deve aspettare (di seguito)
I processi che devono avere accesso alla sezione critica devono quindi avere una struttura ben precisa

Dobbiamo fare alcune asserzioni
I due processi possiedono una sincronizzazione nell'ambiente locale (hanno variabili globali in comune
che entrambi possono cambiare)

Esistono 2 tipi di soluzioni HW e SW
Soluzioni SW
Questo problema Ã¨ corretto
Ma cosa succede se i processi concorrenti non sono solo 2 ma N?

Il concetto Ã¨ lo stesso ma ogni processo sceglie un numero (i processi poi verranno serviti in ordine di numero come dal panettiere)

L array chosing serve per far scegliere il numero ad uno alla volta ai processi

Soluzioni HW
Implementazione di due tipi 1. Blocco degli interrupt
Inconveniente dato che potrebbero benire bloccati per troppo tempo 2. Implementazione atomicitÃ 
Ovvero garantire che un operazione verrÃ  eseguita in modo atomico
Ha pero vantaggi e svantaggi
Vantaggi 1. Scalabile
Indipendente dal numero di processi coinvolti
Estensione ad N sezioni critiche immediato
Svantaggi 1. Maggiore complessitÃ  per il programmatore rispetto alle soluzioni SW
Come impongo l'attesa limitata in questi casi? 2. Serve busy waiting
Che vuol dire spreco di CPU

Come sempre la soluzione migliore Ã¨ la via di mezzo fra le due cose
Semafori
I semafori sono una struttura dati che per comoditÃ  indicheremo con S
S possiede 2 primitive atomiche (quindi soluzione mista HW SW)
Â§ Signal V(s) ====> incrementa il valore di S di 1
Â§ Whait P(s) ====> tenta di decrementare il valore di uno ma se non ci riesce attende
Esistono 2 tipi di semafori 1. Binari
In cui S = 0 o 1 2. Generici
In cui S ha valori interi maggiori di 0
Un semaforo molto utilizzato Ã¨ quello cosiddetto mutex ovvero un semaforo inizializzato a 1 che serve per garantire la mutua esclusione

Sincronizzazione generica
Esistono 2 processi P1 e P2 che devono sincronizzarsi rispetto all'esecuzione delle funzioni A e B
P2 puÃ² eseguire B solo se P1 ha eseguito A
Soluzione con utilizzo di un semaforo S inizializzato a 0

Problema dei dining philosofer
N filosofi mangiano e pensano e basta
Attorno ad una tavola con N bacchette e una ciotola di riso
Se un filosofo pensa non interagisce con gli altri
Se un filosofo ha fame prende 2 bacchette e inizia a mangiare
Ne prende una alla destra e una alla sinistra
PuÃ² prenderne una alla volta
Se non ci sono 2 bacchette non puÃ² mangiare
Quando il filosofo termina di mangiare rilascia le bacchette
